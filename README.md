# Virtual Memory Manager
## Requirements
To ensure that everything works as intended, make sure that your system is utilizing Python 3.12.1+
## How to Use
* Begin by opening the corresponding terminal interface that comes equipped with your OS
* With the terminal open, locate the directory containing the source code of this program within your system
* Run the program by entering the following into the terminal:
```bash
python VirtualMemoryManager.py
```
* While the program is running, locate the directory containing the initialization and input files
* It is recommended that both files are place within the same directory containing the source code. This is not necessary, but will allow the user to avoid copying a long path to their respective files
* If the path to both files are the same as the path to the source code, simply provide the names of the respective files to the terminal
* Otherwise, follow the convention:
```bash
[C:\path\to\initialize.txt] [C:\path\to\inputfile.txt]
```
> NOTE: It is important that the 2 input files are separated by a SPACE

If successful, the program will create an ***output.txt*** file within the same directory as the source code
